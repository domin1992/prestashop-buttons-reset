# prestashop-buttons-reset
It's been annoing for me modifying button styles in default-bootstrap Prestashop theme, so I made buttons reset syles.

# Usage
1. After install Prestashop 1.6 copy and paste these styles into `/themes/default-bootstrap/css/global.css`
2. Start creating your own styles after mine.

### Warning!
All of button styles has been reseted includig default bootstrap like btn-primary, btn-danger and btn-succes with all hover, focus and active pseudo-classes. If you don't like it just remove styles you want to leave default from Prestashop.
